Great job overall, only 1 issue:

1. On the client side, the TransferService.class could have been
organized a little bit better. 

- For example the public Transfers[] transfersList() method returns
an array but it also prints out a report. Ideally, this method should
just return the array and let some other method or code in the CLI handle
the printing and the system outs.
